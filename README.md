In this study, we developed a novel 3D convolutional neural network (3D CNN) model to
identify zinc-binding ligands within protein structures. The model incorporates
a self-attention mechanism, allowing it to prioritize relevant spatial features for
zinc coordination. We trained and evaluated the model using a dataset of protein
structures with known zinc-binding sites, achieving relatively good
performance compared to existing methods that rely solely on sequence or
geometric feature analysis. Metal3D has a precision of more than 0.8 at
confidence levels down to about 0.6 at the highest confidence, and a mean
absolute deviation of less than 1Ã… at higher confidence levels, with median
values significantly lower than those of other prediction tools.
